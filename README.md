Sure, here's a README.md file template for both scenarios:

### LAMP Stack with Docker Compose

#### Overview
This Docker Compose setup provides a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack environment for local development or testing purposes. It includes the following services:
- **frontend**: Apache web server hosting PHP files.
- **mysql**: MySQL database server.
- **phpmyadmin**: PHPMyAdmin for MySQL database management.

#### Prerequisites
- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose

#### Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory containing the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
3. Customize environment variables in the `.env` file if needed.
4. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the services.
5. Access your web application at `http://localhost`.
6. Access PHPMyAdmin at `http://localhost:8089` (default credentials: username - `${MYSQL_USER}`, password - `${MYSQL_PASSWORD}`).

#### Configuration
- Environment variables can be customized in the `.env` file.
- MySQL data is persisted using Docker volumes. The volume `tt_mysql-data` is created for MySQL data storage.

### LAMP Stack with Kubernetes

#### Overview
This Kubernetes configuration provides a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack environment for container orchestration. It includes the following resources:
- **Deployment**: Manages the deployment of pods for each service.
- **Service**: Exposes the deployed services internally within the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., minikube, Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled)
- kubectl command-line tool

#### Usage
1. Apply the Kubernetes configuration files in the `kubernetes/` directory using `kubectl apply -f <filename>`.
2. Access your web application through the exposed service.
3. Access PHPMyAdmin through the exposed service.

#### Configuration
- Environment variables can be configured directly in the Kubernetes manifests, such as Deployment and Service files.
- Persistent storage for MySQL data can be configured using PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim.
